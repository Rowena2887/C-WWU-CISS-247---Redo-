Program:
1. The user inputs digit(s) and scale size.
a.) Convert digit string into integers.
2. The program prints the integers according to the submitted scale size.

FUNCTION intTrans

Example:
'0' -> 48 (48 - 48 = 0)
'1' -> 49 (49 - 48 = 1)
'8' -> 56 (56 - 48 = 8)
'9' -> 57 (57 - 48 = 9)

Instructions:
1. Loop through digits string and translate them into integers.
a.) Cannot use atoi() because the function is expecting a string not a character.
b.) Can directly subtract characters since characters are integers under the hood in C.

Tricks: 
1. Don't use atoi(argv[1]) because it will translate the string of integers into one whole integer rather than a string of integers.
2. Split the integer by zones, top, middle, and bottom so the program can focus on printing one section at a time. Keep it simple!
3. Instead of treating each integer separately, by printing one integer at a time, treat them as one giant singular integer. Meaning, don't focus on printing individual integers, focus on printing all the integers based on levels (nested for loops).
4. The middle zone was the most challenging since integers are oddly shaped, so the middle zone was split up by three parts, upper (level < scale / 2), middle (level == scale / 2), and lower (level > scale / 2). Print according to levels and insert new line when needed.
5. Scaling needs to be doubled every time to keep the middle zone equally consistent for oddly shaped integers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9).
6. Keep track of how many digits the user inputs so the program prints exactly as shown.

The if statement is called a single selection statement because it selects or ignores a single action. 
The ifâ€¦else statement is called a double-selection statement because it selects between two different actions. 
The switch statement is called a multiple-selection statement because it selects among many different actions.
