FIND FUNCTION

Example:
String: "This is a test. Find string."
Find: "st"

Instructions:
1. Compare each character from the string with the first character of the substring.
2. If there is a match, save string character location. Store character into new array.
REMEMBER, this is where you left off in the string so you will need a counter.
3. Take next character of substring and compare it to the next strings character.
REMEMBER, this is where you left off in the substring so you will need a counter for here too.
4. If next character in the substring does not match string, erase new array. Setting array counter back at 0. Also, set substring counter back at 0.
5. If next character in the substring does match the string, store character into new array.
6. Repeat until new substring is complete, then break out of the loop and compare strings.

REPLACE FUNCTION

Example:
String: "I like lemon cubes."
Find: "lemon"
Replace: "melon"

Given: # of where the first letter or new word starts

Instructions:
1. Loop string:
a.) The start is located where the first character of the substring starts.
2. Loop new string:
a.) Take letters of new string and insert into string.
b.) Keep counter of which letter (index) you left off in new string.
c.) Break when complete.
